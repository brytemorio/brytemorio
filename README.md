Stereo typical geek who is more passionately drawn to wrting
software at the lower level details for Computing Systems. 

My interest can be sumed up according to
the following fields of research:

* Machine learning / Autonomous,
* Embedded / Real-Time Systems,
* Telecommcation/Satellite networking/ Satellite Geodesy / Global
Positioning Systems
* Software Define Radio
* Machine Vision
* Augmented/Virtual Reality
* Quantum Computers.

I often find inspiration from research projects by Darpa and IARPA,
defense contractors such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics
and even design firms such are Anduril and SpaceX.
